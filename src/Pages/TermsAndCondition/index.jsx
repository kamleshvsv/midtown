          ScriptSite may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external
          business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest
          to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable
          information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not

          partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or
          postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All
          such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information
          except to provide these services to ScriptSite, and they are required
          to maintain the confidentiality of your information.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          ScriptSite may disclose your personal information, without notice, if
          required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action
          is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with
          legal process served on ScriptSite or the Site; (b) protect and defend
          the rights or property of ScriptSite; and/or (c) act under exigent

        </p>
        <div className="g-maring-top"></div>

        <h5>Tracking User Behavior</h5>
        <p>
          ScriptSite may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit
          within ScriptSite, in order to determine what ScriptSite services are
          the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and
          advertising within ScriptSite to customers whose behavior indicates
          that they are interested in a particular subject area.{" "}
        </p>
        <div className="g-maring-top"></div>

        <h5>Automatically Collected Information</h5>
        <p>
          Information about your computer hardware and software may be
          automatically collected by ScriptSite. This information can include:
          your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and
          referring website addresses. This information is used for the
          operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to
          provide general statistics regarding use of the ScriptSite website.{" "}
        </p>

        <div className="g-maring-top"></div>

        <h5>Use of Cookies</h5>
        <p>
          The ScriptSite website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your
          online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
          disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
          deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
          you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
          the cookie to you.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
          feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
          server that you have returned to a specific web page. For example, if
          you personalize ScriptSite web pages, or register with ScriptSite site
          or services, a cookie helps ScriptSite to recall your specific
          information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
          recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
          shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same ScriptSite
          website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so
          you can easily use the ScriptSite features that you customized.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
          automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
          setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
          cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
          features of the ScriptSite services or websites you visit.{" "}

        <h5>External Data Storage Sites</h5>

          This Section only applies to Users and Customers of the Services that
          are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and/or
          Switzerland (collectively, the “Designated Countries”) at the time of
          data collection. We may ask you to identify which country you are
          located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your
          IP address to identify which country you are located in. Where we rely
          only on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this Section to
          any User or Customer that masks or otherwise obfuscates their location
          information so as not to appear located in the Designated Countries.
          If any terms in this Section conflict with other terms contained in
          this Policy, the terms in this Section shall apply to Users and
          Customers in the Designated Countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          ScriptSite is a data controller with regard to any personal
          information collected from Customers or Users of its Services. A “data
          controller” is an entity that determines the purposes for which and
          the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third
          parties that act as our service providers are “data processors” that
          handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may object to our processing at any time and as permitted by
          applicable law if we process your personal information on the legal
          basis of consent, contract or legitimate interests. We can continue to
          process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense
          of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable
          law.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we process your personal information based on a contract with you
          or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by
          automated means, you may request to receive your personal information
          in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to
          have us transfer your personal information directly to another
          “controller”, where technically feasible, unless exercise of this
          right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you believe we have infringed or violated your privacy rights,
          please contact us so that we can work to resolve your concerns. You
          also have a right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory
          authority situated in a Member State of your habitual residence, place
          of work, or place of alleged infringement.

          treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email
          address specified in your account, by placing a prominent notice on
